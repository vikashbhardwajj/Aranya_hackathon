# 🌿 Aranya — A Tribute to Mother Nature

“Born not in boardrooms, but beneath the banyan shade.”

**Aranya** is a nature-inspired web experience built to reconnect people with the essence of Earth. Through symbolic products, visual storytelling, and poetic design, Aranya is a digital homage to our planet — every element crafted with reverence.

## 🪴 About the Project

> “Each creation is a silent prayer to the planet we call home.”

Aranya is not an e-commerce platform — it's a **spiritual storefront** of natural icons like trees, rivers, birds, and air. These are **not for sale** but celebrated to inspire action, awareness, and connection.
